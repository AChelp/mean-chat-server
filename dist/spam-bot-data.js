var facts = "Superman Didn\u2019t Always Fly.\n\nThe original comic book Superman could leap tall buildings in a single bound. But then he had to come right back down to Earth\u2014because he didn\u2019t fly. It wasn\u2019t until the 1940s, when animators for a new animated series decided it would be too difficult to routinely draw him bending his knees, that it was decided that Superman could take off into the air. Readers got to see smooth animation and a superhero gained a new power.\n\n*-*The First Computer Was Invented in the 1940s.\n\nThese days, supercomputers are everywhere\u2014and they really don\u2019t need much space at all. Have an Xbox One posted up in your living room? That\u2019s a supercomputer. A laptop-tablet hybrid in your bag? That\u2019s a supercomputer, too. (Don\u2019t even get us started on the thing in your pocket\u2026) But when supercomputers first came around, they needed much, much more space. Just take a look at the world\u2019s first one: The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC).\n\nOriginally built at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s School of Engineering, in 1946, ENIAC weighed 60,000 pounds and took up a room larger than most studio apartments (1,500 square feet). Shortly after construction, ENIAC was sent off to the military, where it was used to calculate ballistic trajectories (translation: launch missiles) with frightening accuracy. Today, computer experts at Penn credit ENIAC with heralding in the \u201Cdawn of the information age.\u201D\n\n*-*Space Smells Like Seared Steak.\n\nWhen you see footage of astronauts floating peacefully in space, do you ever wonder, What does space smell like?  Well, according to some former astronauts, space does have a distinct odor that hangs around when they come back in the ship after a spacewalk. They\u2019ve described it as \u201Chot metal\u201D or \u201Csearing steak.\u201D\n\n*-*The Longest Wedding Veil Was the Same Length as 63.5 Football Fields.\n\nWhen Maria Paraskeva, a woman from Cyprus, got married in August 2018, her goal wasn\u2019t just to say \u201CI do.\u201D She was also determined to set a record. \u201CMy dream as a child has always been to break the Guinness World Record title for the longest wedding veil,\u201D she explained. She fulfilled her dream by wearing a lace veil that stretched 22,843 feet and 2.11 inches, or as long as 63.5 football fields.\n\n*-*The Unicorn Is the National Animal of Scotland.\n\nWhile Scotland proudly boasts the Loch Ness Monster, one of the world\u2019s most famous fabled creatures, the country opted to make another mythical beast its national animal: the unicorn. Although this might seem like an odd choice, Visit Scotland explains that unicorns played an integral role in the country\u2019s history. Back in the 12th century, William I used the \u201Cproud beast\u201D in the Scottish royal coat of arms.\n\n*-*Bees Sometimes Sting Other Bees.\n\nBees are notorious for their stings, but humans aren\u2019t the only ones who experience this pain in the neck (or the arm, or the leg\u2026). In protecting their hives from outsiders, some \u201Cguard bees\u201D will stay by the entrance and sniff the bees that come in, says Marianne Peso from the biology department of Macquarie University. If there\u2019s a rogue bee from another hive trying to steal some nectar, the guard bee will bite and even sting the intruder.\n\n*-*Kids Ask 300 Questions a Day.\n\nA 2013 U.K. study from online retailer Littlewoods.com observed young children and recorded the questions they asked the adults around them. The children tended to turn to their mothers for answers, and these moms could end up answering an average of nearly 300 questions per day, or one question every two-and-a-half minutes, the study found. The moms reported that the hardest questions they were asked included \u201CWhy is water wet?\u201D and \u201CWhat are shadows made of?\u201D\n\n*-*The Total Weight of Ants on Earth Once Equaled the Total Weight of People.\n\nEntomologists have estimated that there are at least one million trillion insects and only one percent of that number is ants, according to the BBC. And if you took all those ants (about ten thousand trillion) and put them on one side of a giant scale, you could almost put all of the people in the world onto the other and balance things out. Unfortunately, as humans have become heavier, this probably wouldn\u2019t hold up today\u2014but it once did. Francis Ratnieks, professor of Apiculture at the University of Sussex, told the BBC this might have held true around 2,000 years ago.\n\n*-*\u201CE\u201D Is the Most Common Letter and Appears in 11 Percent of All English Words.\n\nTry writing out a few sentences\u2014anything at all. Now take a minute to look at how frequently each letter in the alphabet appears. Chances are you\u2019ll see a lot of the letter \u201Ce.\u201D That\u2019s because the commonly used vowel appears in around 11 percent of all words in the English language, according to Oxford Dictionaries. The next most popular letter was \u201Ca,\u201D which appears in around 8.5 percent of all words. The least common letter is \u201Ca,\u201D which appears in just 0.2 percent of words.\n\n*-*A Dozen Bodies Were Found in Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Basement.\n\nBut were you aware of the fact that multiple skeletons were found in the basement of Benjamin Franklin\u2019s London home? The bones were discovered during a 1998 renovation of the house and were identified as being from nearly a dozen people, including six children. \u201CThe most plausible explanation is not mass murder, but an anatomy school run by Benjamin Franklin\u2019s young friend and protege, William Hewson,\u201D wrote The Guardian.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t any funny business going on. \u201CThe resurrection men could deliver bodies stolen from graveyards to the Thames wharf at the bottom of the street, while there was a weekly public execution at the gallows on the other side of the garden wall.\u201D\n\n*-*The Healthiest Place in the World Is in Panama.\n\nA small valley near Volc\u00E1n in Panama has garnered the distinction of being the world\u2019s healthiest place to live, according to a 2018 report by International Living. Called Shangri-La Valley, the area is home to beautiful scenery, a low cost of living, and a significantly longer life expectancy than the surrounding areas. All in all, the world\u2019s healthiest areas have some common factors, according to the ranking: a warm climate, an active social scene, healthy food, and a slower pace of life that makes for less daily stress.\n\n*-*A Pharaoh Lathered His Slaves in Honey to Keep Bugs Away From Him.\n\nThe pharaohs of ancient Egypt were believed to be literally divine. The word pharaoh itself means \u201Cgreat house,\u201D as in the house of God. In fact, King Pepi II, who supposedly ruled for 90 years, thought so highly of himself that when he was bothered by insects, he would command that one of his slaves be covered in honey to lure the flies away from himself.\n\n\n*-*Some People Have an Extra Bone in Their Knee That Is Getting More Common.\n\nIf you were under the impression that the human body had finished evolving, think again. It turns out that some people have a bone in their knee called a fabella. And while this particular little bone with an unknown purpose was once fading away, over the last century and a half, it\u2019s gotten more common. Back in 1875, nearly 18 percent of people examined had a fabella. That number dropped to 11 percent by 1918. However, by 2018, 39 percent of individuals had this mysterious bone.\n\n*-*Pringles Aren\u2019t Actually Potato Chips.\n\nThe next time you see a can of Pringles, take a closer look\u2014you won\u2019t see the word \u201Cchip\u201D anywhere on the packaging. That\u2019s because Pringles aren\u2019t made of thinly-sliced potatoes, but instead dehydrated potato flakes pressed into their signature parabolic shape. That\u2019s what makes them less greasy. But when other potato chip manufacturers complained, the Food and Drug Administration ruled that Pringles couldn\u2019t be marketed as chips. The company eventually settled on \u201Cpotato crisp.\u201D\n\n\n*-*There\u2019s a Giant Fish With a Transparent Head.\n\nThe deepest levels of our oceans are some of the least explored areas of the planet. Because of the extreme pressure, cold, and dark at these depths, only the very strangest of creatures can survive there. These include giant tube worms, vampire squids, goblin sharks, and viperfish with teeth so long that they can\u2019t close their mouths. Perhaps the strangest, though, is the barreleye, a large fish with a completely transparent head.\n\n*-*There\u2019s a Decorated War Hero Dog.\n\nWhile in the trenches of World War I, the U.S. First Infantry Division found themselves unable to communicate with other troops because shellfire had damaged the telephone wires. A young private came up with a unique solution: Rags, a mixed breed terrier whom the soldiers had adopted in Paris, would carry the messages from one division to the next tucked into his collar. He saved many lives, and when Rags passed away\u2014in Maryland, at the very advanced age of 20\u2014he was buried with military honors.\n\n*-*Showers Really Do Spark Creativity.\n\nShowers aren\u2019t just good for your hygiene\u2014they\u2019re good for your creativity, too. For a 2012 study published in the journal Psychological Science, researchers gave volunteers creativity problems to solve followed by a period of rest. During that period, some were assigned demanding tasks, while others did simpler tasks that allowed their minds to wander (just like a shower does). Those doing the simpler tasks during the resting time were more likely to solve the original creativity problems.\n\n*-*Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Bodyguard Left His Post at Ford\u2019s Theater to Go for a Drink.\n\nYou already know that Abraham Lincoln was shot and killed by John Wilkes Booth while watching a performance at Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865. But what you might not have been aware of is that the president had a bodyguard named John Frederick Parker with him on that fateful night, according to Smithsonian.\n\n  Unfortunately, Parker was a police officer with a less-than-stellar reputation. After arriving three hours late for his shift, the officer left his post protecting the president to get a drink at the Star Saloon next door to the theatre. It was during this time that Booth entered the box seats where Lincoln was sitting and shot the president.\n\n*-*Dolphins Have Been Trained to Be Used in Wars.\n\nDolphins are known widely as adorable, intelligent animals. What is not as widely known is that these crafty creatures were used largely by the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Vietnam War and the Cold War. Both countries studied the creatures for their sonar capabilities, but also trained them to detect mines, bring equipment to divers, find lost equipment, and guard submarines amongst other nifty tricks.\n\n*-*Playing the Accordion Was Once Required for Teachers in North Korea.\n\nThe most popular instrument in North Korea is the accordion, so much so that all teachers used to be required to play to get their teaching certifications. Because the accordion is portable in a way that, say, a grand piano isn\u2019t, it was thought of as the \u201Cpeople\u2019s instrument\u201D that could be taken outside and played for laborers in the fields.\n\n*-*Children\u2019s Medicine Once Contained Morphine.\n\nIf you were a baby in the middle of the 1800s and you cried while teething, your parents might have given you Mrs. Winslow\u2019s Soothing Syrup. This \u201Cmedicine\u201D claimed that \u201Cit soothes the child, it softens the gums, [and] allays all pain.\u201D It may have done plenty of soothing, but it was also extremely dangerous\u2014this concoction, like many patent medicines of the time, contained morphine.\n\n*-*Plastic Easter Eggs and Plastic Easter Grass Were Invented by a Man Who Holds More Patents than Thomas Edison.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever enjoyed an Easter basket with plastic eggs and grass, then you can thank Donald Weder, the man who invented both. Weder not only holds the patents on these holiday staples, he also holds a total of 1,413 U.S. patents\u2014including ones for water-based inks, flower-pot covers, and decorative wrappers. That\u2019s compared to Thomas Edison, who held just 1,093 U.S. patents.\n\n\n*-*Water Makes Different Pouring Sounds Depending on its Temperature.\n\nIf you listen very closely, hot water and cold water sound slightly different when being poured. The heat changes the thickness, or viscosity, of the water, which changes the pitch of the sound it makes when it\u2019s poured. What we feel as heat comes from the molecules of the water moving faster. Cold water is thicker and therefore makes a slightly higher-pitched sound.\n\n*-*Most Laughter Isn\u2019t Because Things Are Funny.\n\nEvery culture in the world laughs, but surprisingly, most of our laughter isn\u2019t necessarily a response to humor. Less than 20 percent of laughter comes after jokes, according to neuroscientist Robert Provine; the rest is a reaction to regular statements and questions like, \u201CHow have you been?\u201D The ensuing laughter, however brief, helps form social bonds since people who laugh together grow closer.\n\n*-*One Man Saved More than 200 People from Suicide.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad fact the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is a site where many suicides take place. However, one California Highway Patrol officer has done more to combat this problem than any other individual. Officer Kevin Briggs, who battles depression himself, has personally talked more than 200 people down from the proverbial ledge throughout his career. After retiring in 2013, Briggs wrote a book called Guardian of the Golden Gate and now goes on speaking tours to encourage public discussion of suicide and mental illness.\n\n*-*Our European Ancestors Were Cannibals.\n\nIn 16th and 17th century Europe, cannibalism was actually a fairly common practice, and it was all for medical purposes. The practice seems to have started because Egyptian mummies were thought to have magical curative properties\u2014so they were ground up and put in many remedies.\n\n  As the idea evolved, human bone, blood, and fat were all used in medical concoctions. Got a headache? Crush a skull and make it into tea! While medical cannibalism has fallen out of favor, modern medicine still sometimes uses one human body to heal another in the form of blood donations, organ transplants, and skin grafts.\n\n*-*Dogs Actually Understand Some English.\n\nSome owners of disobedient dogs may have trouble believing this, but dogs can learn to recognize a vocabulary of about 165 words. Unsurprisingly, dogs respond best to short words, as well as words with hard consonants like \u201Ct\u201D or \u201Cr,\u201D which may explain why they can hear \u201Ctreat\u201D from three rooms away.\n\n  If you want to try to expand your dog\u2019s vocabulary, be consistent\u2014for example, always call a meal \u201Cdinner\u201D instead of breakfast, lunch, or supper. And don\u2019t believe the myth: Old dogs can learn words just as well as young dogs.\n\n*-*You Have a Nail in Your Body.\n\nOr, at least, the components of one. Iron is an important nutrient that the human body needs. It helps your red blood cells carry oxygen, which is necessary for producing energy throughout the body. That\u2019s why an iron deficiency can present itself with feelings of exhaustion. Amazingly, a healthy adult has about three grams of iron, enough that, if it were pulled out and melted down, it could form a nail up to three inches long.\n\n*-*Redheads Aren\u2019t Going Extinct.\n\nPeriodically, a rumor starts on the internet that says natural redheads will become extinct by the year 2060. Lucky for gingers everywhere, this is a myth. It\u2019s true that the gene that causes red hair is recessive, meaning that both parents must have it for their child to have red hair. However, even non-redheads can carry the red hair gene, and it can pop up unexpectedly in generations down the line.\n\n*-*Pro Baseball Once Had Women Players.\n\nWhile there are currently no female players in Major League Baseball, there have been plenty of women in professional men\u2019s leagues. The first was Lizzy Arlington, who pitched during the ninth inning for the Reading Coal Heavers in 1898 and won her team the game. A little over 30 years later, an African-American woman, Jackie Mitchell, pitched against the Yankees during an exhibition game, striking out both Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. What\u2019s more impressive: Mitchell was 17 years old at the time.\n\n*-*Koalas Have Fingerprints.\n\nChimpanzees and gorillas have human-like fingerprints and so do koalas. In fact, koala prints are very similar to human fingerprints, even to expert crime scene investigators. As of yet, no koalas have framed humans for their crimes, but now we know it\u2019s not impossible\u2026\n\n*-*Humans Are Just One of the Estimated 8.7 Million Species on Earth.\n\nHuman beings may dominate the planet with our sprawling cities and far-reaching technology, but we are, in fact, just one species among some 8.7 million that live together on planet Earth. One 2011 study published in the journal PLoS Biology estimated that \u201Cthe various forms of life on the planet included 7.8 million species of animals, 298,000 species of plants, 611,000 species of mushrooms, mold and other fungi, 36,400 species of protozoa, and 27,500 species of algae or chromists.\u201D And it\u2019s worth noting that the researchers did not venture to put an estimate on the number of bacteria.\n\n*-*Riding a Roller Coaster Could Help You Pass a Kidney Stone.\n\nAfter multiple people reported they had passed a kidney stone while riding Walt Disney World\u2019s Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride, a research team from Michigan State University decided to investigate the phenomena in 2016. They conducted tests with a model kidney and found that there was a 64 percent kidney stone pass rate for those seated in the rear of the Thunder Mountain ride. That number was just 16 percent for those seated in the front.\n\n*-*Dinosaurs Lived on Every Continent.\n\nBack in their day, dinosaurs lived on every continent on Earth, including Antarctica. The reason we only find their bones in certain places, though, is that weather and soil conditions in those places were just right for the bones to be fossilized. Scientists also speculate that there may be many smaller-sized dinosaurs that we know nothing about because their bones were too small to fossilize well.\n\n*-*Bee Hummingbirds Are So Small They Get Mistaken for Insects.\n\nHummingbirds are known for being itty-bitty creatures, but Bee Hummingbirds are the teeniest versions of these shockingly tiny flyers. They\u2019re actually the smallest bird in the world. They are so minuscule that they are sometimes mistaken for insects (which explains their name), according to the National Audobon Society. The birds are just two and a quarter inches long and weigh less than a dime.\n\n*-*Sea Lions Can Dance to a Beat.\n\nThere are only two mammals on Earth with the proven ability to move their bodies in time with an external beat: humans (though not all humans, to be fair) and sea lions. When researchers at the University of Santa Cruz rescued a stranded sea lion in 2013, they found that she was very smart, and she was even able to learn how to dance. Though parrots can also keep a rhythm, it was previously thought that only animals capable of complex vocal learning could do this.\n\n*-*37Rolls-Royce Makes the Most Expensive Car in the World\n  \nCurrently, the most expensive car in the world is a Rolls-Royce Sweptail that sold for  13 million. However, even if you have that kind of dough lying around, you won\u2019t be able to buy it\u2014only one was made, and it was custom-built from the ground up according to the buyer\u2019s specifications. But brand-new custom cars have nothing on used classics; the recent sale of a 1963 Ferrari GTO for  70 million is supposedly the highest price ever paid for a car.\n\n*-*The Famed \u201CTyphoid Mary\u201D Infected More Than 50 People by Cooking for Them.\n\n\u201CTyphoid Mary\u201D was a real historical person who became notorious in the early 1900s. She was an Irish woman named Mary Mallon who immigrated to the United States in the 1880s. Though she had no symptoms of typhoid fever, she carried the bacteria in her blood and could pass it on to other people. Because no doctor could convince her that this was true and she didn\u2019t feel sick, she insisted on working as a cook. During her career, she infected at least 51 people, three of whom died, before she was isolated in enforced quarantine for the last decades of her life.\n\n*-*The Legend of the Loch Ness Monster Goes Back Nearly 1,500 Years.\n\nThere\u2019s a tale written in the year 565 A.D. that speaks of an Irish monk traveling through Scotland. While there, Saint Columba heard stories of a \u201Cwater beast\u201D that attacked and killed the local people when they went in the river. Wanting to help, the monk used his friend as bait to lure the beast into sight, at which point Columba commanded it to \u201Cgo no further,\u201D and the creature stopped and swam back upstream. That river is now known in Scotland as the River Ness, which flows out from the famous Loch Ness.\n\n*-*Nutmeg Can Be Fatally Poisonous.\n\nA little dash of nutmeg in a pumpkin pie or on your egg nog can give it some extra flavor and a lovely spicy scent. Too much nutmeg, however, can be toxic. Two to three teaspoons of raw nutmeg can induce hallucinations, convulsions, pain, nausea, and paranoia that can last for several days. Actual fatalities are rare, but they have happened.\n\n*-*Chinese Police Use Geese Squads.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of police dogs, but police geese? As of 2013, 12 police stations in a rural area of China have begun to use geese as sentries. They are alert animals and, as you probably know, can create a lot of noise and commotion, which creative Chinese law enforcement officers are taking advantage of. While this trend has yet to spread throughout China, Dongwan police claim that the geese have already stopped at least one theft.\n\n*-*The First iPhone Wasn\u2019t Made by Apple.\n\nThe first mobile device to be called an \u201CiPhone\u201D was made by Cisco, not Apple. It allowed the user to use the voice functions of Skype without a computer. Apple announced its own product just 22 days later, and Cisco sued for trademark infringement. The lawsuit was ultimately settled out of court and both companies were allowed to keep using the name. However, you\u2019ve probably never heard of the Cisco iPhone.\n\n*-*There\u2019s a Country Where Twins Are Most Likely to be Born.\n\nBenin, a country in central Africa, is notable for having the highest birth rate of twins in the world. While the world average is just 13 twins per 1,000 births, Benin more than doubles that rate, at nearly 30 twins per 1,000 births. There\u2019s no single factor that causes this, but genetics, diet, and even the mother\u2019s height are thought to play a role.\n\n*-*The Comic Sans Font Came from an Actual Comic Book.\n\nMost adults nowadays who know anything about graphic design steer away from using the Comic Sans font in formal documents. The font was designed by Vincent Connare, who drew direct inspiration from his favorite comic books, including Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\u2019 celebrated Watchmen series.\n\n*-*For 100 Years, Maps Have Shown an Island That Doesn\u2019t Exist.\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Sandy Island, a land mass about the size of Manhattan in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Australia. Supposedly, explorer James Cook discovered it in 1876, and it began appearing on nautical maps in 1908. It wasn\u2019t until 2012, when a team of Australian scientists set out to survey the island, that they discovered there was no island there at all. The scientists guessed that Cook may have in fact spotted a \u201Cpumice raft\u201D of floating volcanic stone and gas. The Sydney Morning Herald even published an obituary for Sandy Island.\n\n*-*Babies Are Physical Anomalies.\n\nBabies, particularly newborns, are surprisingly different from the children they\u2019ll grow up to be. When they\u2019re born, their heads account for a quarter of their full body weight, and the size of their brains will double in the first year of life. Babies have 300 bones and around 10,000 tastebuds all over their mouth. Some of the bones will fuse as they age (into 206, as an adult), but the tastebuds not on the tongue will eventually vanish.\n\n*-*The Queen Has Some Hidden Hideaways.\n\nSince the early 13th century, the city of London has officially paid rent to the Crown for two small pieces of property. Fortunately for the city, the price has stayed the same for more than 800 years: one knife, one ax, six horseshoes, and 61 nails, presented every autumn in the Ceremony of Quit Rents. Although one of these properties is located in the Moors in Shropshire and the other is near the Royal Courts of Justice in the city itself, no one knows the exact location of the Queen\u2019s land. And for more weird celebrity trivia, don\u2019t miss the 20 Craziest Celebrity Rumors of All Time.\n\n*-*The Man Who Wrote Dracula Never Visited Transylvania.\n\nBram Stoker was an Irish author who is now best remembered for his gothic horror novel Dracula. Partially set in Transylvania, a mountainous region in central Romania, the story cemented the legend of the vampire in mainstream European and American culture. Despite Stoker\u2019s many world travels, he never visited Eastern Europe\u2014and, by virtue, Transylvania\u2014at all.\n\n*-*The Australian Government Banned the Word \u201CMate\u201D for a Day.\n\nThere are probably slang or informal words that get on your nerves from time to time, particularly when you think something should be taken seriously. In 2005, Australian Parliament took a few citizen complaints a little too seriously and banned anyone on their staff from using the word \u201Cmate\u201D while at work. Fortunately, Prime Minister John Howard objected, claiming that \u201Cmate\u201D was an important part of Australian culture, and the ban was overturned within 24 hours.\n\n*-*Many Languages Have the Same Roots.\n\nEnglish, Portuguese, Latvian, Pashto, and Greek all sound very different today, but these languages all have a common ancestor called Proto-Indo-European. Though we don\u2019t have any written examples of it, linguists have worked backwards from a variety of modern languages to try to reconstruct it. Using their reconstruction, the sentence \u201CThe king wanted a son\u201D would be written as \u201CH3r\u1E17\u1E31s s\u00FAhxnum u\u032Fl\u0325nh1to.\u201D\n\n*-*A Tick Bite Can Make You Allergic to Red Meat.\n\nPlenty of people have food allergies, but few are the result of an insect bite. In a strange and growing trend, some people who get bitten by the Lone Star tick can develop a sudden allergy to red meat. Beef, lamb, and pork (which are technically classified as red meat) can make people with this allergy experience headaches, sneezing, a runny nose, and nausea. In severe cases, it can cause the person to be unable to breathe. For some sufferers, the allergy fades over time, but for others, it\u2019s permanent.\n\n*-*Harriet Tubman Was Even More Heroic Than You Thought.\n\nYou probably know that Harriet Tubman was a former slave who became a political activist for the abolition movement. But in addition to smuggling escaped slaves through the Underground Railroad, during the Civil War she was the first woman to lead an armed assault. She planned and executed a number of raids and was known to carry a revolver for personal protection.\n\n*-*Tornadoes Can Cause \u201CFish Rain\u201D.\n\nTornadoes can develop over water just as well as they can over land. When they do, they\u2019re called \u201Cwaterspouts,\u201D and they suck up large amounts of lake or sea water\u2014as well as whatever\u2019s swimming in that water. If the waterspout travels on to the land and the winds decrease, there\u2019s nowhere for those fish to go but down. As far as we know, there\u2019s no tornado powerful enough to pick up sharks, but a fish-nado is entirely possible.\n\n*-*Napoleon Was Once Attacked by Thousands of Rabbits.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte was once one of the most powerful men in Europe, but he suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands (or paws) of rabbits. After a military victory, Napoleon\u2019s chief of staff organized a rabbit hunt to celebrate. Thousands of rabbits were brought in to be set loose, but instead of hopping away when the cages were opened, they turned to attack, swarming the partygoers. After trying and failing to shoo them away, the great Emperor Napoleon ran for the safety of his carriage.\n\n*-*Star Trek\u2018s Scotty Stormed the Beach at Normandy.\n\nCanadian actor James Doohan, best known for playing Montgomery \u201CScotty\u201D Scott on the original Star Trek series, served in World War II with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. As a commissioned lieutenant, he led his troop up a mine-strewn Juno Beach as part of the Allied Forces\u2019 D-Day invasion. Later in the day, he was wounded by friendly fire that caused the amputation of the middle finger on his right hand. You might not have noticed it because, during his time on Star Trek, directors did the best they could to avoid showing the injury on screen.\n\n*-*Apple Pie Isn\u2019t Actually American.\n\nApples originally come from Asia. The first pies were baked in Medieval Europe. Even the concept of putting apples in pie traces back to a recipe from England in 1381. Nevertheless, the phrase \u201Cas American as apple pie\u201D turned up by 1924 and became a common saying during the years of the Second World War.\n\n*-*Pigs Are Constitutionally Protected in Florida.\n\nFirst written in 1838, the Constitution of the state of Florida guarantees the right to privacy, the freedom of speech, and the right of pregnant pigs to be free from cages. Unlike many crazy or outdated laws, this amendment is recent (passed in 2002) and comes from a well-meaning place: the prevention of cruelty to animals. During pregnancy, a pig must not be caged or even tethered such that it can\u2019t turn around freely.\n\n*-*Mr. Cherry Breaks All the Records You\u2019ve Never Heard Of.\n\n  Japan\u2019s record breaker for most records broken is Cherry Yoshitake, a children\u2019s entertainer who goes by \u201CMr. Cherry.\u201D In 2018 alone, Mr. Cherry set one-minute records for the most pairs of underwear pulled on (36), the most baked beans eaten (71), and the most apples bobbed (37).\n\n*-*Sweat Doesn\u2019t Actually Stink.\n\nYou might notice that any sweat you produce right after a shower doesn\u2019t smell so bad. That\u2019s because your sweat itself isn\u2019t stinky; it\u2019s the bacteria on your skin that breaks the sweat down that causes the odor. Additionally, you\u2019ll find that the sweat on your arms and legs doesn\u2019t smell as much as your armpits. That\u2019s because sweat glands in your armpits secrete more protein into a dark, damp environment\u2014the perfect place and food for bacteria.\n\n*-*60Some Planets Produce Diamond Rain\ndiamond real missing treasure\n\nSaturn and Jupiter are gas giant planets that produce a truly unique form of weather. Recently, scientists discovered that there is plenty of carbon in these atmospheres. When carbon soot gets hit by lightning, it hardens into graphite and falls downward, where the pressure of the atmosphere hardens it further, until it becomes\u2026 a diamond!  Storms on these planets may literally rain diamonds as big as a centimeter across.\n\n*-*Sharks Can Live For Five Centuries.\n\nGreenland Sharks are known to be some of the oldest living animals in our world. Researchers did carbon dating on a Greenland Shark that was caught in 2014 and found it to be around 392 years old. Further testing revealed that our fishy friends could be up to 500 years old. Yes, that would mean that our geriatric friends would have been alive when Leonardo Da Vinci painted the \u201CMona Lisa.\u201D\n\n*-*There\u2019s an Entire Town Under a Rock.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been accused of \u201Cliving under a rock,\u201D you\u2019ll feel right at home in Setenil de Las Bodegas in Spain. Many of this tiny town\u2019s 3,000 residents live and work and play in a gorge beneath a huge rocky outcropping, where homes are built right into the rock. It provides so much shelter that historians think this area has been occupied by human settlements since the Stone Age.\n\n*-*It Is Illegal to Sell a \u201CBounceless\u201D Pickle to Somebody in Connecticut.\n\nThis law put Connecticut Librarians in quite the pickle. The law actually arose as a legend and the people demanded the truth. For hours, librarians in the state scanned past archives of laws within the state until one librarian eventually found the truth in the Hartford Courant. The law was in fact an ordinance that was created in 1945 to thwart pickle packers Moses Dexler and Sidney Sparer. These two men were selling inedible pickles, so laboratories conducted experiments and found that if it doesn\u2019t bounce, don\u2019t eat an ounce!\n\n*-*The Bermuda Triangle Isn\u2019t Any More Likely to Cause a Mysterious Disappearance Than Anywhere Else.\n\nThis area in the North Atlantic Sea is also called \u201CThe Devil\u2019s Triangle\u201D because it is an area of the ocean that stretches between the tip of Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico. It has been thought to seemingly swallow up ships and aircrafts. Explorers as far back as Christopher Columbus have reported odd occurrences, like fireballs in the sky (that turned out to be a meteor crashing).\n\nBut historians, scientists, and the U.S. Coast Guard have proven that vessels are no more likely to disappear in the Bermuda Triangle than they are anywhere else in the ocean. Many prior disappearances have been demystified as remains of numerous wrecks were discovered or explained by weather patterns in the area at that time.\n\n*-*There\u2019s a World Record\u2014and a Happy Ending\u2014for the Greatest Distance Thrown in a Car Accident.\n\nThis is one world record you may not want to try and top. A car traveling 70 miles per hour struck Matthew McKnight, an off-duty paramedic, when he stopped to help out with an accident on the side of an interstate in 2001. He was thrown 118 feet, almost half a football field.\nDr. Eric Brader, his emergency room physician, told McKnight he should send it into the Guinness Book of World Records, but McKnight brushed it off as a joke. Brader was so impressed by the feat that he sent in the paperwork anyways, which was approved in 2003, but didn\u2019t make the cut until its 2008 edition.\n\n*-*You Can Sneeze Faster Than a Cheetah Can Run.\n\nClocking in at 100 mph, we can sneeze faster than cheetahs run, four-and-a-half times faster than Usain Bolt\u2019s record, and 20 times faster than Michael Phelps. (Unfortunately, we also expel about 100,000 germs when we sneeze.)\n\n*-*The Fire Hydrant Patent Was Lost in a Fire.\n\nThe fire hydrant patent is credited to Frederick Graff Sr., who was the chief engineer for Philadelphia Water Works during the early 1800s. Unfortunately for Graff Sr., the patent was destroyed when the patent office in Washington, D.C., burned down in 1836. After 100 years, retired firefighter George Sigelakis reinvented the hydrant after they had been failing to work in too many critical emergencies.\n\n*-*Saudi Arabia Imports Camels From Australia.\n\nSaudi Arabia is known for its vast expanse of desert, so it may seem unbelievable that they rely on Australia to supply them with animals that dominate their landscape.\nAustralia originally had camels imported to be used for transporting heavy loads or for riding. They were let loose when their work was done, causing an unwanted spike in their population. Australians then sold the camels back to desert-based countries like Saudi Arabia, which use camels at a much higher volume.\n\n\n*-*One Man Survived Two Atomic Bombs.\n\nTsutomu Yamaguchi survived both nuclear attacks to Japan when the U.S. dropped atomic bombs during World War II. Yamaguchi, sent to Hiroshima on business on August 6th, 1945, saw the U.S. drop the first atomic bomb. Miraculously, he survived with burns across his face and arms, but made it home to Nagasaki. Three days later, the second atomic bomb hit, flattening Yamaguchi\u2019s home. Because his family was out finding ointments to treat his already existent burns, they were safe in a tunnel and miraculously survived as well.\n\n*-*The Cast of Friends Still Earns Around  20 Million Each Year.\n\nWhen the show came to an end, the cast of the popular TV show Friends negotiated syndication rights for themselves. That means they receive a percentage of the revenue (2 percent) from reruns airing across all broadcasting companies. Since the much-loved TV show still pulls in around  1 billion of revenue, Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry all make major dough each year for doing, well, nothing\u2014 20 million is the estimate.\n\n*-*Pluto Technically Isn\u2019t Even a Year Old.\n\nPluto was discovered on February 18th, 1930. It is the farthest (dwarf) planet from the Sun, requiring it to go a much farther distance than we are used to on Earth. It takes 248 Earth-years for Pluto to complete one rotation of its own around the sun. This places Pluto\u2019s first birthday since its discovery on Monday, March 23, 2178.\n\n*-*Cows Kill More Americans Each Year Than Sharks Do.\n\nWhile sharks account for about 53 bites per year, only one of those ends up being fatal. Cows, on the other hand (or hoof), kill around 20 people per year.\n\n*-*Newborns Don\u2019t Have Kneecaps.\n\nThis belief is only a half truth, as babies actually technically do have kneecaps when they are born. Those knees just aren\u2019t hardened yet, and remain soft cartilage throughout their childhood until they eventually turn into bone.\n\n*-*In Germany, People Help Toads Cross the Road.\n\nYou might not want to bring up the popular video game Frogger in Germany. There, they like to protect their frogs, toads, and other amphibians. In order to save them from harm when crossing the street, conservation organizations installed more than 800 fences along popular roadways. Along these fences are buckets, so when they try to cross, they eventually hop into one. At the end of the day, wildlife conservationists collect the buckets and release frogs across the road into a nearby forest with ponds and lakes.\n\n*-*Cheetahs Don\u2019t Roar.\n\nCheetahs can\u2019t roar, but they can purr, meow, hiss, bark, and growl instead. This type of behavior is much like the domestic cats we keep in our homes.\n\n*-*France Has A Dozen Time Zones.\n\nThe country with the widest stretch of land, Russia, spans 11 different time zones. France, though, technically has the most, clocking in at 12\u2014but that\u2019s due to the fact that its territories are dispersed in various parts of the world. The U.S. ties with Russia in second, but not all time zones are inhabited.\nSo, Russia is the only place in the world where one citizen could be waking up at 8:00 a.m. and another could be going to bed at 11:00 p.m.\n\n*-*The Majority of Americans Choose Dogs Over Love.\n\nDogs have been known for the longest time as man\u2019s best friend, but Americans are increasingly taking that to a new level. A 2017 study from Rover.com conducted over three years found that 54 percent of dog owners are willing to end a relationship if their pup doesn\u2019t like their partner.\nThe study also found that 94 percent of dog owners consider their dogs to be a part of their family, and 78 percent include their pups in major family moments. Since one in four people said they bring their cuddly companions on first dates, maybe consider bringing dog treats instead of flowers next time.\n\n*-*Star Wars Was Expected to Be a Flop.\n\nThe original 1977 Star Wars had a budget of  8 million, which distributor 20th Century Fox was reluctant to give to director/writer George Lucas, so he accepted a lower salary in order to keep the budget. The movie went on to make  775 million around the world, and Disney picked up the entire franchise for  4 billion. For comparison, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which was released in 2017, had a reported budget of  317 million.\n\n*-*Your Liver Can Regrow Itself in Three Weeks.\n\nThe Greeks had it right with Prometheus, it turns out. According to Greek mythology, the titan was punished by having an eagle eat his liver day after day. The liver would regrow at night, leaving Prometheus at the bird\u2019s mercy.\nIt turns out, the regenerative properties of this story are partially true: Doctors have found that the liver can regrow in three weeks, not one day.\n\n*-*Danes Bred a Pig to Look Like the Flag.\n\nIn the early 20th century, those who resided in North Frisia under Prussian rule were not allowed to raise the Danish flag. But some crafty North Frisians took action by breeding a pig, known as the Danish Protest Pig, to be red in color, with a large white stripe around its belly\u2014thus creating an animal version of the flag. As they technically did not break the law, and because it wouldn\u2019t have been feasible to ban the breeding of pigs, the Danes successfully protested Prussia.\n\n*-*A 70-Year-Old Woman Completed Seven Marathons in Seven Days, Across all Seven Continents.\n\nChau Smith was always an avid runner, and, in 2017, she decided that for her 70th birthday, she would complete seven marathons in one week across all of the continents. Traveling made it challenging\u2014for example, Smith made the race in Egypt just minutes before the start because her plane to Cairo was delayed. But despite the obstacles, she completed her goal.\n\n*-*Dogs Like Squeaky Toys For a Dark Reason.\n\nEver wonder why your little puppy obsesses over those squeaky toys? Because dogs are descendants of wolves whose instincts include hunting smaller animals. The sound a squeaky toy makes is very similar to the sound a small animal makes when being hunted. When Ol\u2019 Lassie hears that, she gets excited because of these killer survival skills.\n\n*-*The Man Who Founded Atari Started Chuck E. Cheese.\n\nIn 1972, Nolan Bushnell started the gaming company Atari, which gave us the classic arcade game Pong. Bushnell sold the company just four years later and the following year, he opened Chuck E. Cheese! In fact, there is one game in Chuck E. Cheese that actually is called Ping, a knockoff of his original arcade game, which he couldn\u2019t use since he no longer owned it.\n\n*-*One Man Was Constipated for Nearly Two Months.\n\nIn 1965, 26-year-old Angus Barbieri, who weighed 456 pounds, was put on a fasting program. It wouldn\u2019t be ethical to conduct a study like this today, but at the time, things were different, allowing Barbieri\u2019s doctor, William Stewart, to experiment. On a strict regimen of multivitamins and minerals, Barbieri got his nutrients without eating a scrap of food, which resulted in nearly two months of constipation. By the end of the year, Barbieri was 180 pounds. (Note: Fasting to this degree is not recommended, as it can lead to serious health conditions.)\n\n*-*Most People Break up on Mondays.\n\nSearching through public Facebook data, Lee Byron and David McCandless found that relationships statuses changed for the worse two weeks before Christmas, around Easter, and on Mondays. Though this data may be somewhat misleading, as people might not be live-updating their breakups, it shows an obvious trend.\n\n*-*There May Be 2,000 Active Serial Killers in the U.S. Right Now.\n\nThomas Hargrove has been archiving homicides for years through his Murder Accountability Project. Through his experience, he came up with an algorithm that found patterns in recent unsolved murders linked to at least one other murder through DNA. This allowed him to estimate the number of unsolved cases in the U.S. at any given time. According to the New Yorker, he believes that the number of active serial killers in the U.S. is around 2,000.\n\n*-*Beethoven Could Still Hear After Going Deaf.\n\nUpon going deaf, Beethoven discovered that if he bit onto a metal pole that connected to the piano he was playing, he could hear almost perfectly well. This process is called bone conduction, and while technology has evolved, the science is the same: Vibrations are transferred from the conductive metal into our bones. When this happens, our ears pick up the signal with no sound distortion.\n\n*-*Ants Have a Built-In FitBit.\n\nWhile previous research found that ants use visual cues, a 2007 study discovered that desert ants have an internal pedometer that helps them keep track of their travels and find their way back home.\n\n*-*Stressed Men Have Altered Proclivities.\n\nA 2012 study published in the journal PLoS ONE found that men who are feeling stressed out prefer women with curvier figures. The study had one experimental group perform a stressful activity, while the other control group did not. Afterward, they were shown pictures of women with various body types. When the men in the control group were asked to rate the women on a scale of one to nine, they rated pictures of women with higher BMIs as the most attractive.\n\n*-*Crows Holds Grudges.\n\nIn 2010, researchers in Seattle found that formerly captured crows were able to remember the face of their abductor even years after the incident. Once they identified the suspect in question, they would threaten them by diving down and swarming the person that they had felt threatened by years before.\n\n*-*Canada Once Heavily Targeted LGBTQ Individuals.\n\nOur Canadian neighbors may not have been as friendly as we thought. During the Cold War era, Canada spent thousands on its historic \u201CFruit Machine.\u201D This device was supposedly able to identify gay men and lesbian women by monitoring subjects as they were shown pornographic images with homosexual content.\nThis, unfortunately, led to the wrongful persecution of many of Canada\u2019s fine citizens. In 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for the mistreatment of these men and women.\n\n*-*Bill Gates Has Donated Nearly Half His Fortune.\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates encourages the Giving Pledge, a notion that, if you are fortunate enough, you should be giving 50 percent of your wealth to those who need it most. As of 2013, he has donated  28 billion and has saved around 6 million lives by bringing vaccines and better healthcare to people worldwide.\n\n*-*You Can Always \u201CSee\u201D Your Nose.\n\nThe human brain is capable of amazing things, but in order to do those things, it needs to block out distractions through a process called unconscious selective attention. The nose is one of those distractions. In his landmark 1960s study, Ulric Neisser discovered this phenomenon after he asked participants to count the number of times basketball players passed a ball in a video. What the large majority failed to notice in the video was a girl walking through the middle of the court with an umbrella, because they were so focused on counting.\n\n*-*A Restaurant in New York Employs Grandmas as Chefs.\n\nIt is true that everybody thinks their Italian grandma\u2014or nonna\u2014is best cook around. So it was a genius idea when Joe Scaravella decided to gather up as many nonnas as he could to work in his restaurant in Staten Island. Enoteca Maria combines the skill of these delightful, talented grandmothers and has them create and cook recipes from their own family cookbooks.\n\n*-*Shaq Only Made One Three-Pointer.\n\nShaquille O\u2019Neal made the only three-point shot he would ever make in his entire career on February 16, 1996. When the Orlando Magic played the Milwaukee Bucks, O\u2019Neal received an almost full-court pass before he shot the three-pointer. Despite being the only official three-point shot in his career, he went down in NBA history as one of the greatest of all time.\n\n*-*America\u2019s First Bank Robber Deposited the Money Back Into the Same Bank.\n\nAt the Bank of Philadelphia on August 1, 1798, a sum of  162,821 was stolen from the vault. There was no sign of forced entry so it was thought to be an inside job. Patrick Lyon was imprisoned as the prime suspect, as he had been the carpenter that worked on the vault doors.\nBut then, they realized a man named Isaac Davis had been depositing large sums of money into the Bank of Philadelphia. It turned out, he was one of the robbers involved. In 1799, Lyon was freed, and Davis only ended up repaying the money without serving a day in jail.\n\n*-*Germany Uncovers 2,000 Tons of Unexploded Bombs Every Year.\n\nDuring World War II, the Allied forces dropped over a total of 2.7 million tons of bombs on Germany. Due to certain defects in their delay timers, a large number of bombs never exploded\u2014around 10 percent, or 200,000 tons. As they\u2019ve been discovered in years since, it\u2019s routine for German citizens to be evacuated from buildings or sectioned off on streets, while bomb experts handle the devices.\n\n*-*Sharks Existed Before Trees.\n\nTrees are young\u2019ns compared to the geezer sharks that rule the sea. Sharks have existed for around 400 million years, while trees became their own official species only 350 million years ago. Other notable animals that outlive our leafy ancestors are the horseshoe crab as well as the jellyfish.\n\n*-*And Trees Weren\u2019t Always Biodegradable.\n\nToday, bacteria and fungi eat away at fallen trees, but that wasn\u2019t always the case. Bacteria had to evolve to eat wood, so hundreds of millions of years go, trees would fall at death, leaving large piles of dead wood. Forest fires of unimaginable proportions would burn the massive mounds of dead wood. And that\u2019s where most of the coal today on Earth came from, according to National Geographic.\n\n*-*Detroit Undercover Cops in A Drug Ring Fought Another Group of Undercover Cops.\n\n\u201CPut your hands up!\u201D \u2026 \u201CNo, you put your hands up!\u201D That\u2019s likely what went down in November 2017 when two groups of undercover cops in Detroit accidentally mistook each other for the drug dealers and buyers they were respectively trying to bust. What ensued during the raid was a stand-off, resulting in fists being thrown while guns were pointed at each other. Internal affairs had to be contacted to put the officers under investigation in an attempt to figure out the unfortunate miscommunication.\n\n*-*Every Time You Shuffle a Deck of Cards, You Get a Combination That\u2019s Never Existed.\n\nYour angsty teenage dreams of being the most original, unique person alive could actually come true! Grab a deck of cards and shuffle. Most likely, you will have created a combination of cards that had never existed yet until that moment. Any math experts out there know that this is because the probability comes out to 52 factorial or 52! (52 x 51 x 50 \u2026 x 2 x 1). The probability that two card shuffles are exactly the same is so small, it likely will never happen.\n\n*-*There Is an Immortal Jellyfish.\n\nWhen it\u2019s an adult, the \u201CImmortal Jellyfish,\u201D scientifically named Turritopsis dohrnii, can transform its cells back to its childhood state. This usually happens when it is physically harmed, sick, or even when it is starving. The jellyfish evolved this skill in order to survive throughout history, specifically when latching onto ships. Since it can hitchhike, its DNA has spread and the not-so-rare species is emerging all over the world.\n\n*-*America Accidentally Dropped an Atom Bomb on South Carolina in 1958.\n\nIn March 1958, a B-47 plane was headed to the United Kingdom and was armed with an atomic bomb. This bomb was even bigger than the \u201CFat Boy,\u201D the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki.\nDuring the flight, the pilots noticed a fault light, so one of them decided to check it out. In doing so, he accidentally released the emergency pin, watching in horror as the bomb dropped to the ground. The good news was, the critical part of the bomb needed to set it off was still on the plane, so it never exploded.\n\n*-*Baby Blue Whales Grow 200 Pounds Per Day.\n\nBlue Whale calves grow 200 pounds per day for the first year they are alive. They can move at a brisk pace of five miles per hour when fully grown, but can get up to 20 miles per hour if need be. They can also hear up to 1,000 miles away in the ocean.\n\n*-*Actor Bill Murray Uses a 1-800 Number Instead of an Agent or Manager.\n\nBill Murray is famous for starring in movies like the original Ghostbusters (1984) and Groundhog Day (1993). But anyone in Hollywood who\u2019s interested in working with him must first navigate a somewhat strange situation in order to get his attention. That\u2019s because the star uses a mysterious 1-800 number instead of an agent or manager.\n\u201CYou just call the 1-800 number,\u201D filmmaker Theodore Melfi, who directed Murray in St. Vincent (2014), told USA Today. \u201CYou have to record the message and send the message. I started calling once a week \u2026 He never called back. I finally called his lawyer and said, \u2018I\u2019m trying [to] reach Bill.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018What number do you got?\u2019 And I go, \u2018I\u2019ve got the 800 number.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what I got.\u2019\u201D\n\n*-*Cats Once Delivered Mail in Belgium.\n\nIn the 1870s, the city of Li\u00E8ge, Belgium, attempted to employ 37 felines as mail carriers, according to the BBC. Messages were tucked into waterproof bags that the kitties would carry around their necks. However, while one cat apparently made it to its destination in under five hours, the other felines took up to a day to complete their journeys. Due to the fact that the cats weren\u2019t particularly reliable and definitely weren\u2019t speedy, the service didn\u2019t last very long.\n\n*-*It\u2019s a Myth that People Are Either \u201CLeft Brained\u201D or \u201CRight Brained\u201D.\n\nYou may have been told at some point in your life that you\u2019re either left brained or right brained. The story goes that \u201Cpeople who are left brain dominant are more quantitative, logical, and analytical, while right-brained individuals are more emotional, intuitive, and creative free spirits,\u201D writes Psychology Today.\nHowever, this theory isn\u2019t true. \u201COn the contrary, most behaviors and abilities require the right and left sides of the brain to work together to achieve a common objective,\u201D the website explains. So while you may have certain qualities and characteristics that define you who are, they have nothing to do with which side of your brain you use more. You can thank both sides of your noggin for contributing to your unique personality.\n\n*-*There\u2019s a Device That Creates Energy from Snowfall.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty darn impressive that scientists have been able to harness energy from the sun, wind, and water, providing us with all kinds of alternative sources of power. And now they\u2019ve managed to create energy from snowfall. According to a 2019 study in the journal Nano Energy, engineers and chemists from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) have developed a device made of silicone that can harness a charge from static electricity.\n\u201CSnow is positively charged and gives up electrons, while silicone is negatively charged and accepts the electrons,\u201D  IFL Science explains. \u201CSo, as the snow lands on the silicone, a charge is produced and then captured.\u201D Think of it like the spark of energy you create when you rub a balloon against your hair.\n\n*-*A Mermaid Documentary Fooled So Many People That the U.S. Government Had to Issue a Statement.\n\nIn 2013, Animal Planet aired Mermaids: The New Evidence, a documentary\u2014or rather, a mockumentary\u2014that \u201Cproved\u201D the half-human-half-fish beings exist. And while the program was fake, plenty of the 3.6 million viewers that watched believed that the fictional claims were real. In fact, so many people were fooled that the U.S. government\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a statement on its website addressing the confusion, saying: \u201CMermaids: The New Evidence is just entertainment. No evidence of aquatic humanoids has ever been found.\u201D\n\n*-*The Iowa State Fair Holds Quirky Competitions Like a Beard-Growing Contest and a Husband-Calling Contest.\n\n  If you\u2019ve ever been to the Iowa State Fair, you\u2019ve experienced the sort of carnival-based fun that it\u2019s been providing since 1886. And if you\u2019ve never been to the annual event, then you should know that you\u2019re missing out on quite a few quirky competitions, including cow-chip and rubber-chicken throwing contests, a husband-calling contest, and a beard-growing contest.\n\n*-*There\u2019s a Textbook Written Entirely by an AI Author.\n\nPublishers are always eager to release something unique\u2014and Springer Nature did just that when they published a textbook by an author named Beta Writer in 2019. No, that\u2019s not a cheeky pseudonym; it\u2019s the name of a machine-learning algorithm designed by researchers from Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. The book is called Lithium-Ion Batteries: A Machine-Generated Summary of Current Research. And while it doesn\u2019t sound like the most interesting material, it is \u201Cthe first machine-generated research book,\u201D according to the academic publishing company.\n\n*-*Earth Won\u2019t Always Have the Same North Star.\n\nThe North Star might seem like a fixed marker in the sky. However, what we now recognize as the North Star, Polaris, hasn\u2019t always been our guiding light\u2014and it won\u2019t always be in the future. By the year 13,000 A.D., the star Vega will take its place, according to NASA. And by the year 26,000, Polaris will be right back where it was and return to its status as the North Star.\n\n*-*There\u2019s an Entire Family in Italy That Feels Almost No Pain.\n\nMembers of the Marsili family handle injuries remarkably well and that\u2019s because they only experience pain for a moment before it fades away. Letizia Marsili told Smithsonian Magazine, \u201CI just thought of it as part of who I was. I was strong, I was resilient. I bounced back.\u201D\nHowever, when a researcher at the University of Siena, where Letizia works, noticed her unusual tolerance for pain\u2014which is something her mother, sister, and son all share\u2014the two decided to collaborate to see what was going on. They discovered that Letizia experiences \u201Cthe good pain, the pain that alerts us to danger. Then it disappear[s]. The bad kind of pain, the chronic pain, the ongoing pain that we take painkillers for\u2014she simply [doesn\u2019t] feel that.\u201D\n\n*-*The Word \u201CHipster\u201D Goes All the Way Back to the 1930s.\n\nWhile \u201Chipster\u201D is used these days to describe someone who tries (perhaps too hard) to be stylish and trendy, the term is actually much older.

The rodents, which had clearly been a part of some sort of ritual, were adorned with earrings and necklaces made from colorful string. \u201CSome were even wrapped in cotton rugs like a sushi roll,\u201D wrote Gizmodo of the findings, which were published in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology in 2019.\n\n*-*Hitler Had a Flatulence Problem.\n\nIn 2012, Adolf Hitler\u2019s medical documents were being auctioned to the public by Alexander Historical Auctions. According to the files, The Telegraph reported, flatulence had become such a pervasive issue for Hitler that he had to regularly ingest 28 different drugs to keep it under control.

Using an electrical field to suspend a charged atom in a vacuum chamber, the team shot a laser beam at the atom and took a photo of the shadow it produced. While atoms have been photographed before, their shadows have not, making this accomplishment unprecedented.\n\n*-*Maine Is the Only State that Borders Just One Other State.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Maine, you\u2019ll find the Atlantic Ocean to the south and Canada to the north. But if you want to stay in the U.S., you\u2019ll have to head west to New Hampshire, because Maine is the only state in the country that borders just one other state.\n\n*-*The Twitter Bird\u2019s Official Name Is Larry.\n\nIf you truly want to be among the savviest social media users out there, you should know that the Twitter bird has an official name: Larry the Bird (yes, like Larry Bird, the former pro basketball player who played for Twitter co-founder Biz Stone\u2019s home team, the Boston Celtics).\n\n*-*The Longest Book Title Contains 1,809 Words.\n\nThe title of Srijan Timilsina\u2019s 2014 Guinness World Record-setting book is practically a full text in itself.

Which ancestor of human being first started to walk with the help of two limbs?\u201D It finally ends with, \u201CSolutions of above inquisitiveness are included in this book,\u201D which you think would go without saying, but perhaps not if you want your title to set a world record.\n\n*-*Allergy Season Is Getting Longer and More Intense Each Year.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the millions of Americans who suffer from allergies, we\u2019ve got bad news for you: Allergy season is getting longer and more intense each year, according to a 2019 study published in The Lancet Planetary Health. Likely another unfortunate result of climate change, scientists have found that pollen counts across the Northern Hemisphere have increased over the last 20 years and that pollen season is increasing 0.9 days a year worldwide.\n\n*-*There\u2019s a Reason There Is a Hole in Your Pen Caps.\nAnd that\u2019s because they\u2019re a choking hazard without them. \u201CIn addition to help prevent the pen from leaking, all of our BIC caps comply with international safety standards that attempt to minimize the risk of children accidentally inhaling pen caps. Some of these vented caps \u2026 have a little hole in the top to comply with the existing safety standards,\u201D the BIC pen company explained on its website.\n\n*-*You Can Learn the High Valyrian Language from Game of Thrones With an Online Course.\n\nFans of George R.R. Martin\u2019s best-selling books and HBO\u2019s hit series Game of Thrones will be able to tell you that High Valyrian is the Latin-like language used in formal circumstances by the fictional nobility of Essos and Westeros. And while the stories may be make-believe, the language is a fully developed form of communication that you can learn yourself thanks to an online course from Duolingo. By the end, you\u2019ll be able to say phrases in High Valyrian like \u201Ckirimvose\u201D (thank you) and \u201Cavy jorr\u0101elan\u201D (I love you), as well as \u201Cbantis z\u014Dbrie issa se oss\u0233ngnoti l\u0113dys\u201D (the night is dark and full of terrors).\n\n*-*Some Maryland Residents Are Taxed for the Rain.\n\nAs they say, \u201Cnothing is certain but death and taxes.\u201D Depending on where in the world you live, rain may be just as much of an inevitability. And for some Maryland residents, rain and taxes are both inescapable and tied together thanks to the \u201Crain tax,\u201D which was passed by the state legislature and signed into law in 2012.\nNine counties, as well as the city of Baltimore, pay the annual fee that the Center for Watershed Protection describes as a \u201Cuser fee charged to property owners for the service of managing the polluted runoff coming from their property.\u201D\n\n*-*Scientists Partially Revived Disembodied Pig Brains.\n\nIn April 2019, a team at Yale was able to restore partial functionality to the brains of decapitated pigs for 10 hours or more after the animal\u2019s death. Neuroscientist Nenad Sestan, who participated in the experiment, explained that the result might allow us to \u201Cbetter understand how brain cells react to circulatory arrest\u201D and \u201Ctest whether some cellular functions can be restored in the brain after death.\u201D\n\n*-*Astronauts in Space Are Exposed to the Same Amount of Radiation as 150 to 6,000 Chest X-Rays.\n\nWhen astronauts leave Earth, they face a range of factors that affect them physically.

The goo is \u201Cgenerally regarded as a safe additive\u201D by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but you\u2019ll probably never come across it in real life because it\u2019s difficult and expensive to collect.\n\n*-*The U.S. Almost Went to War With Canada Over a Pig.\n\nIn 1859, the U.S. almost went to war with Canada because of a pig. Just a few years after the Oregon Treaty was signed to end a border dispute between America and Britain (which still ruled over the area that came to be known as Canada), things got a little heated on San Juan Island where citizens from both countries were located. Historic UK explains that \u201Ca pig belonging to the British accidentally wandered onto the land of Lyman Cutlar, an American farmer. When Cutlar noticed the pig eating some of his potatoes he was incensed, and in a fit of rage shot and killed the pig.\u201D\nDespite efforts to resolve the situation between the two men, things spread into the rest of the community and got to the point where the governor of British Columbia sent three warships to the area. The two sides continued to increase their military force over the following month until British Navy Admiral Robert L.

The American outlaw, who was born in 1868 and was killed in 1908, took his now-historical moniker from the only town that put him behind bars: Sundance, Wyoming. He was jailed there when he was just 15 years old for stealing a horse and was sentenced to 18 months. The Sundance Kid went on to join the Wild Bunch, a group of robbers and rustlers who ranged through the Rocky Mountains in the late 19th century.\n\n*-*Eating Your Offspring May Be a Sign of Good Parenting in Some Species.\n\nThe thought of any creature devouring its babies may be horrific to us, but for some animals, such as certain fish, reptiles, and amphibians, that\u2019s not the case, according to 2019 research published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. Among these creatures, sacrificing some of their young via cannibalism may be a way to help their other offspring survive when overcrowding becomes a problem.\n\n*-*The Word \u201CMacGyvered\u201D Is in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nThe original MacGyver series that ran from 1985 until 1992 featured a main character who could fashion pretty much whatever his heart desired with random objects.

But the spot, which is, in fact, a storm, has been shrinking for a century and a half. Although NASA can\u2019t predict what will happen to the storm that was \u201Conce big enough to swallow three Earths with room to spare,\u201D they do know that it \u201Cseems to have increased in area at least once along the way, and it\u2019s growing taller as it gets smaller.\u201D\n\n*-*Three Eagles Were Found Co-Parenting Three Eaglets in Illinois.\n\nIn a nest overlooking the Mississippi River, one female and two male eagles were found raising three babies together in April 2019.

Elsie is also the town\u2019s mayor, bartender, and librarian, and is responsible for paying herself taxes and granting herself a liquor license. As of 2018, the tiny population makes Monowi the only incorporated town in the U.S. with only one resident, according to the BBC.\n\n*-*When President Carter Pardoned Draft Dodgers, Only Half Returned.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, many men who were drafted into the military refused to serve for various reasons and instead left the country to avoid prosecution. Then, in 1977, newly inaugurated President Jimmy Carter fulfilled one of his campaign promises by pardoning draft dodgers. This allowed them to return home without the fear of being arrested. Despite this, only around half actually came back. Many of them assumed that they would still face ill-will from the American public and had already settled into places like Canada that welcomed the healthy and educated workforce.\n\n*-*The Amazon River Dolphin\u2019s Brain Capacity is 40 Percent Larger than Humans\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly well known that dolphins are incredibly clever animals\u2014and that\u2019s thanks in part to what\u2019s inside their noggins. Amazon River dolphins\u2014the wonderfully pink creatures that are also known as Boto or Boutu\u2014have a brain capacity that is 40 percent larger than that of humans. Bottlenose dolphins also have larger brain capacities than humans do\u20141,600 grams versus 1,300 grams, according to the American Association of Advancement of Science.\n\n*-*There\u2019s a Scottish Term for Hesitating When Introducing Someone Because You\u2019ve Forgotten Their Name.\n\nWe\u2019ve all likely been there: You run into someone and you go to introduce them to whoever you\u2019re with and you can\u2019t remember their name for the life of you! There happens to be a Scottish term for this awkward hesitation. So if you (unfortunately) ever find yourself in that situation you can say, \u201CPardon my tartle!\u201D\n\n*-*Earth Is Hit With More Energy from the Sun Each Hour than the Planet Uses in a Year.\n\nSolar panels are a popular choice for anyone who\u2019s interested in living a more planet-friendly existence. And if you ever thought there might not be enough sunlight to go around, then think again. Some 430 quintillion Joules of energy from the sun hits the Earth every hour, while the entire population of the planet only uses 410 quintillion Joules each year, according to the U.S. Department of Energy via Business Insider.\n\n*-*The Queen Celebrates Two Birthdays Every Year.\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was born on April 21, 1926, which is why she celebrates her actual birthday each spring. However, the head of the British royal family also observes a second \u201Cofficial\u201D birthday celebration called the Trooping the Colour. King George II started the tradition in 1748 because his own birthday was in November, which was too cold for an annual parade. He decided to hold an additional ceremony during the warmer weather.\n\n*-*Scientists Can Identify the Brain Waves That Signal Someone is Having an Angry Dream.\n\nScientists are getting better at decoding our dreams. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Neuroscience included the fact that researchers had identified brain activity patterns that predict states of anger during dreams. Pilleriin Sikka, the lead author of the study from the University of Sk\u00F6vde, explained, \u201CPrevious studies have shown that frontal alpha asymmetry is related to anger and self-regulation during wakefulness. We show that this asymmetrical brain activity is also related to anger experienced in dreams. Frontal alpha asymmetry may thus reflect our ability to regulate anger not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state.\u201D\n\n*-*McRib Sandwiches Contain About 70 Ingredients.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s McRib is a popular choice for fast-food lovers, but those who indulge in the saucy sandwiches might want to be aware of the fact that they\u2019re made with a lengthy list of ingredients. According to Time, the McRib contains 70 ingredients, 34 of which are in the bun alone. And while you might assume that these ingredients are spices or other natural food-related flavors, anyone who eats one of these sandwiches will also be ingesting azodicarbonamide, a flour-bleaching agent used in the production of foamed plastics for things like gym mats and the soles of shoes.\n\n*-*The Apollo Astronauts\u2019 Footprints on the Moon Could Stay There for 100 Million Years.\n\nWhen the Apollo astronauts walked on the surface of the moon, they left behind footprints that will remain there for a very long time. Due to the fact that there is no atmosphere on the moon and therefore no wind or water to blow or wash anything away, Arizona State University scientist Mark Robinson told Space that traces of the Apollo exploration could last between \u201Cten and a hundred million years.\u201D '";
